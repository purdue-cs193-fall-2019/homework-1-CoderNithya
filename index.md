# Nithya's First CS193 Homework

**My favourite things about CS193:**
- _Noah and Albert!_ : Awesome people -- they make the class super interesting. 
- _Terminal_         : I find terminal very fun and useful, and I have spent a couple of hours experimenting random      commands. (So far, I haven't deleted anything important! ) 
- _Use of iClickers_ : The quizzes are enjoyable and really test if the students are paying attention or not. 
- _Classroom size_   : It is small and comfortable. 
- _No Exams_         : It isn't as stressful as the other courses. I'm not learning anything for the sake of an exam, I'm doing it for myself. 
- Content            : The content is excellently designed. The slides have useful information, but aren't boring at the same time.
